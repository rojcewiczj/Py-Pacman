# Py-Pacman
Pacman style python game

---- update as of Sept 9th 2020:
you can now play my game at https://py-pacman-javascript.vercel.app/


This was a solo project I did for myself, to see how well I understood 2-D arrays, classes, pathfinding algorithms and many more powerful and fundamental tools of programming!
I used very few outside references for design or implementation, so what you see is essentially from my own thinking. 
After developing the logic and functionality, I turned towards recreating the functionality of the game in React. This required
translating all my Python code to Javascript, as well as implementing a system to update state and trigger rerendering.

Just to high light a few interesting solution I came up with to get this project working....

Here I have a class for rerendering the map every second and moving all enemy entities towards the player. I did this my retooling a javascript component initially designed to rerender a clock as the hands change position. 

    class Render_Map extends React.Component {
      constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = {map: elem.Map(),
        div: startOrStop()};
      }

      componentDidMount() {
        this.timerID = setInterval(
          () => this.tick(),
          1000
        );

        this.timerID = setInterval(
          () => this.update_buttton(),
          100
        );


      }

      componentWillUnmount() {
        clearInterval(this.timerID);
      }

      tick() {
        if (running == true){
        enem.move(enem, elem)
        enem1.move(enem1, elem)
        enem2.move(enem2, elem)
        enem3.move(enem3, elem)

      }

        this.setState({
          map: elem.Map(),

        });
      }

      }
