# Py-Pacman
Pacman style python game

---- update as of Sept 9th 2020:
you can now play my game at https://py-pacman-javascript.vercel.app/


This was a solo project I did for myself, to see how well I understood 2-D arrays, classes, pathfinding algorithms and many more powerful and fundamental tools of programming!
I used very few outside references for design or implementation, so what you see is essentially from my own thinking. In order to play the game, simply clone or copy my code into any python capable enviroment, run the file and open the terminal. Thank you for your time and I hope you have fun!

After developing the logic and functionality, I turned towards recreating the functionality of the game in React. This required
translating all my Python code to Javascript, as well as implementing a system to update state and trigger rerendering.
