# Py-Pacman
Pacman style python game

This was a solo project I did for myself, to see how well I understood 2-D arrays, classes, pathfinding algorithms and many more power tools for programming!
I used no outside references for design or implementation, so what you see is entirely from my own thinking. Inorder to play the game, simply clone or copy my code into any python capable enviroment, run the file and open the terminal. Thank you for your time and I hope you have fun!
